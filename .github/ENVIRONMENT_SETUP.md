# GitHub Environment Setup for PR Review Workflow

This document explains how to set up the `pr-review-env` environment that provides access control for the PR review workflow.

## Setting up the Environment

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Environments"

2. **Create New Environment**
   - Click "New environment"
   - Name it: `pr-review-env`
   - Click "Configure environment"

3. **Configure Environment Protection Rules**

   ### Required Reviewers
   - Check "Required reviewers"
   - Add the GitHub usernames of people who should approve PR review runs
   - You can add up to 6 reviewers
   - At least one reviewer must approve before the workflow can run

   ### Wait Timer (Optional)
   - You can set a wait timer if you want a delay before approval
   - This is optional for this use case

   ### Deployment Branches (Optional)
   - You can restrict which branches can trigger this environment
   - For PR reviews, you might want to allow all branches

4. **Environment Secrets (If Needed)**
   - Add any secrets that should only be available to this environment
   - These could include API keys for security scanning tools
   - Database credentials for testing
   - Third-party service tokens

## How the Workflow Works

1. **PR Creation**: When a PR is created, the workflow is triggered
2. **Environment Protection**: The workflow waits for approval from designated reviewers
3. **Manual Approval**: One of the authorized people must approve the run
4. **Code Execution**: The workflow runs with the PR code in a secure environment
5. **Results**: The workflow provides feedback on the PR

## Benefits of This Setup

- **Security**: Prevents malicious code from running automatically in forks
- **Control**: Only trusted team members can trigger sensitive operations
- **Visibility**: All approvals are logged and auditable
- **Flexibility**: Can be configured per repository and environment

## Customizing the Workflow

The workflow file `.github/workflows/pr-review.yml` can be customized to:

- Add specific testing commands
- Include security scanning tools
- Run deployment tests
- Perform code quality checks
- Send notifications to external systems

## Troubleshooting

- **Workflow not triggering**: Check that the environment name matches exactly
- **Approval not working**: Verify reviewers have the correct permissions
- **PR code not accessible**: Ensure the fetch and checkout steps are working correctly
